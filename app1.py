        üëã About Me

        I am an AI Engineer & Data Scientist with a strong foundation in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Generative AI. I specialize in building end-to-end AI solutions that transform ideas into impactful real-world applications.

        ‚ú® Highlights of my work include:

        LLaMA-Pen ‚Äì an AI-powered blog generator with full MLOps integration (MLflow, DVC, CI/CD, AWS).

        River Plastic Detection ‚Äì a YOLOv8-based computer vision system to detect plastic waste in rivers.

        CareCast ‚Äì a TensorFlow CNN model achieving 92%+ accuracy in medical image classification.

        ‚öôÔ∏è My toolbox includes PyTorch, TensorFlow, MLflow, Docker, FastAPI, Streamlit, Power BI, and deployment expertise on AWS, GCP, and Hugging Face Spaces.

        üéØ With internship experience in data analytics and predictive modeling, and certifications in Python, Computer Vision, and MLOps, I bring both practical industry experience and cutting-edge technical skills.

        üåç My passion lies in LLMs, MLOps-driven AI systems, and scalable computer vision applications. I aim to build AI solutions that don‚Äôt just work in research‚Äîbut thrive in the real world.


        I am a passionate Data Scientist and AI Engineer with hands-on experience in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Generative AI. 
        I have a proven ability to design and deploy end-to-end AI solutions, from data collection and preprocessing to model training, deployment, and monitoring. 
        My expertise includes working with LLMs (LLaMA 2), MLOps (MLflow, DVC, CI/CD), and advanced computer vision models (YOLOv8), demonstrating my strength in translating cutting-edge research into impactful real-world applications.

        I have built and deployed projects such as an AI blog generator using LLaMA 2 with a complete MLOps pipeline, a YOLOv8-based river plastic detection system, and a CNN-powered health prediction tool.
        These projects showcase my ability to combine model development, cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, Hugging Face), and visualization (Streamlit, Power BI) into scalable, user-centric solutions.

        Alongside my technical expertise, I bring practical experience from internships where I developed interactive dashboards in Power BI and contributed to predictive modeling and EDA pipelines.
        I hold a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence from Pune University and have certifications in Python, Computer Vision, and MLOps from globally recognized platforms.

        Currently, my focus is on Large Language Models, MLOps-driven workflows, and real-world computer vision solutions, with the goal of building reliable, scalable, and impactful
        AI systems that bridge the gap between research and business outcomes.
